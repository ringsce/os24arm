/**
 * @file virtio_gpu.h
 * @brief Minimal virtio-gpu 2D driver (real control-queue protocol)
 *
 * Unlike drivers/video/virtiofb.c's old virtio_gpu_init() - which only
 * does the MMIO status-register handshake and then relies entirely on
 * gui/ramfb.h to actually reach the display - this speaks the real
 * virtio-gpu command protocol: GET_DISPLAY_INFO, RESOURCE_CREATE_2D,
 * RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING, SET_SCANOUT, TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D,
 * RESOURCE_FLUSH. ramfb already works and needs none of this for plain
 * 2D output; the reason to have a real virtio-gpu driver at all is that
 * it's the only path that can later negotiate VIRTIO_GPU_F_VIRGL for 3D -
 * ramfb is a dead end for that.
 *
 * Requires the VM to be started with "-device virtio-gpu-device" (the
 * virtio-mmio transport, matching gui/virtio_input.c's slot-scan - NOT
 * "virtio-gpu-pci", which lives on a different bus this driver doesn't
 * probe). Safely does nothing (returns false) if that device isn't
 * attached, leaving ramfb as the display path.

 * `width`x`height` 32-bit XRGB pixels (matching FB_COLOR's byte layout,
